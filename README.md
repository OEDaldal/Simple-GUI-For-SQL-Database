This Project was made for the course COMP353 Databases. This is an end term project that me and 3 of my friends worked together to create. 
For security reasons the information related to the database is omitted in this repository.
Further improvements to the GUI will be done solely by me outside of the projects due to me wanting to improve my skills.
Below you can find the names and contributions of my fellow group members.

Omer Ege Daldal: Developing the GUI, connecting the database to the GUI, and checking the normal forms.
Pavneet Goraya: Creating and testing triggers, generating emails, logging them, and helping with the queries.
Pratyaksh Patel: Developing the E/R Diagram according to the constraints, creation of the tables, insertion in tables and query output verification.
Sarthak Vashisth: Creating most of the queries and testing them, as well as insertion operations on tables.

All members have reviewed each other's work to ensure the report is created according to the instructions provided. 
All members communicated effectively with each other so that no member was given more work than the others.
